# MSAE-fall2020-CodePrep

## Initiatives
This repo is created for students who are interested in the Data Science path of MSAE program. 

As I was TAing for MSAE ECON691-01 Professor Nihar's class this summer(2021-summer), I realized that students are heavily relied on built-in support from packages such as Sklearn. However, they acutally do not fully understand the underlying logic of these built-in packages, and failed to build custom functions to meet the demand when the problems are slightly modified. And cannot intepret the solution from the instrcutor to improve the next assignment. 

So, if you are passionate about incoming Online Experiment classes, Machine Learning classes but do not have any coding experiences yet, or have very little coding experience, and want to prepare ahead. Welcome to this MSAE Fall 2020 Code Preparation Class.

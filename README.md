# MSAE-fall2020-CodePrep

This repo is created for students who are interested in the Data Science path of MSAE program. 
As I was TAing for MSAE ECON691-01 Professor Nihar's class this summer, I realized that students are heavily relied on built-in support from packages such as sklearn. However, they acutally do not understand the underlying logic of these built-in packages. And cannot intepret the solution from the instrcutor.

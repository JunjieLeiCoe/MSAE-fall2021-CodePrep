# MSAE-fall2021-CodePrep

## Initiatives
This repo is created for students who are interested in the Data Science path of MSAE program. 

As I was TAing for MSAE ECON691-01 Professor Nihar's class this summer(2021-summer), I realized that students are heavily relied on built-in support from packages such as Sklearn. However, they acutally do not fully understand the underlying logic of these built-in packages, and failed to build custom functions to meet the demand when the problems are slightly modified. And cannot intepret the solution from the instrcutor to improve the next assignment. 

So, if you are passionate about incoming Online Experiment classes, Machine Learning classes but do not have any coding experiences yet, or have very little coding experience, and want to prepare ahead. Welcome to this MSAE Fall 2020 Code Preparation Class.

# Course Details

### Teaching Staff
* Junjie(me) will be teaching this introductory course.

### Class Time
* The desired course meet time is Monday & Thursday from 4 to 5pm. But it is still TBD.

* The classroom is still TBD.


### Office Hours
* Junjie is available on Slack and email.

### Laptop Policies
* You can follow along the class as I type into my computer, but the general policy is that you keep your labtops closed during the lecture time to avoid distractions. 

* The machine that I will be using to demo the class is MacBookPro-13 inch version. It is also okay that you are using a windows machine, but the configuration will be slightly different, although I believe that most the part is similar. 



## Student Evaluation

***This class has no exams, correspondingly, no credit will be rewarded & counted towards graduation. It is purely depends on the students' motivation to participate in this class or not.***  

* All the assignment information and class materials can be access from Junjie's GitHub repositoy (this repository). Each students will have a general lecture session on Monday & an interactive coding session on Thursday. 

* On the first 10-20 minutes of Monday's session, Junjie will review students' submission and list common errors and improvement suggestions. 

* On the first 10-20 minutes of Thursday's session, Junjie will review Monday's lecture materials and post the coding assignments accordingly. Students are expected to solve the coding assignments during classtime. If not, Junjie will show the students how to solve it in the last 10-20 minutes.  

* There will be a Take-Home Challenge each week assigned to students who finished the in-class assignments. 

* All the students need to submit/commit their assignment to the GitHub repository for Junjie to review before Monday's class.
